# Project Overview

## Team Members
- Ming Xia

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a multifunctional app that provides several utilities:
- **Alarm**: Set up and manage alarms.
- **World Time Check**: Check the time in different time zones. This feature is set up to manually input time data due to the API not being free.
- **Flight Time**: Check flight times by manually entering data. Ideally, this feature would automatically fetch data using the flight number from an API.

## Technologies Used
- **Platform**: iOS
- **Programming Language**: Initially planned with SwiftUI, but was later switched to another approach due to team decision changes.

## Features
- **Alarm**: Users can set and manage alarms within the app.
- **World Time Check**: Allows users to check and compare the time across different time zones manually.
- **Flight Time**: Manually enter flight numbers to retrieve and display flight times. Ideally designed to automatically scrape data from an API.

## Setup and Build Instructions
There are no special setup requirements or dependencies to run the app, as API keys or server setups are not required for the current implementation.

### How to Build and Test
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your IDE (Xcode recommended for iOS).
3. Build and run the project directly from the IDE.

## Potential Improvements
- **API Integration**: Future implementations could include connecting to APIs for the World Time and Flight Time features to fetch data automatically.
- **User Interface**: Enhance the user interface to improve usability and aesthetics.

## Licensing
The project is open-source, licensed under the MIT License.
